# in this example we force the parallelism to be 2,
# so the callsite will be in a parallel run to the macro definition.
# what should we do here? we will have to suspend, but we can only run the suspension after
# that macro is finished compiling, which may take several runs, its probably best to identify
# just that suspension is required and forbid it (only forbidden in this parallel case, but as this is non-deterministic the user should probably enable the Yno-suspended-units option)
