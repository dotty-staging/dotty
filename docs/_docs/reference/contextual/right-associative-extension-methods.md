<!-- In case the names of the clauses are modified, also modify them in ClassLikeSupport, Desugar, and RefinedPrinter -->

The most general signature an extension method can have is as follows:
  - An optional type clause `leftTyParams`
  - A possibly empty list of using clauses `leadingUsing`
  - A single parameter `leftParam` (in an explicit term clause)
  - A possibly empty list of using clauses `trailingUsing`
  - A name (preceded by the `def` keyword)
  - An optional type clause `rightTyParams`
  - An optional single parameter `rightParam` (in an explicit term clause)
  - Any number of any clauses `rest`

For example:

```scala
  extension [T]                               // <-- leftTyParams
            (using a: A, b: B)(using c: C)    // <-- leadingUsing
            (x: X)                            // <-- leftParam
            (using d: D)                      // <-- trailingUsing
    def +:: [U]                               // <-- rightTyParams
            (y: Y)                            // <-- rightParam
            (using e: E)(z: Z)                // <-- rest
```


An extension method is treated as a right-associative operator
(as in [SLS ยง6.12.3](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/06-expressions.html#infix-operations))
if it has a name ending in `:`, and is immediately followed by a
single explicit term parameter (in other words, `rightParam` is present). In the example above, that parameter is `(y: Y)`.

The Scala compiler pre-processes a right-associative infix operation such as `x +: xs`
to `xs.+:(x)` if `x` is a pure expression or a call-by-name parameter and to `val y = x; xs.+:(y)` otherwise. This is necessary since a regular right-associative infix method
is defined in the class of its right operand.

### Natural Order Right-Associative Extension Methods
If the right-associative extension methods is defined as infix, then the extension is used in its natural order. The `leftParam` is the receiver and
the `rightParam` is the argument. The order of the parameters is kept consistent with the order of the arguments at call site after desugaring.
For instance:

```scala
  extension [T](xs: List[T])
    infix def +:: (x: T): List[T] = ...

  y +:: ys // ys.::y // +::(ys)(y)
```

### Inverted Right-Associative Extension Methods
To make up for the swap in the order at call site,
the expansion of right-associative extension methods performs the inverse parameter swap. More precisely, if `rightParam` is present, the total parameter sequence
of the extension method's expansion is:

```
    leftTyParams  leadingUsing  rightTyParams  rightParam  leftParam  trailingUsing  rest
```

In other words, we swap `leftParams  trailingUsing` with `rightTyParam  rightParam`.

For instance, the `+::` method above would become

```scala
  <extension> def +:: [T]
                      (using a: A, b: B)(using c: C)
                      [U]
                      (y: Y)
                      (x: X)
                      (using d: D)
                      (using e: E)(z: Z)
```

This expansion has to be kept in mind when writing right-associative extension
methods with inter-parameter dependencies. To avoid this limitation use _natural order right-associative extension methods_.

This expansion also introduces some inconsistencies when calling the extension methods in non infix form. The user needs to invert the order of the arguments at call site manually. For instance:

```scala
  extension [T](x: T)
    def *:(xs: List[T]): List[T] = ...

  y.*:(ys) // error when following the parameter definition order
  ys.*:(y)

  *:(y)(ys) // error when following the parameter definition order
  *:(ys)(y)
```

Another limitation of this representation is that it is impossible to pass the
type parameters of the `def` explicitly. For instance:

```scala
  extension (x: Int)
    def *:[T](xs: List[T]): List[T] = ???

  xs.*:[Int](1) // error when trying to set T explicitly
```
